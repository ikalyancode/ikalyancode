  <h1>Hello! I’m Kalyan Nalladimmu, a Software Engineer based in Lakeville, MN.</h1>
  <p>
    Currently, I work as an Adobe Asset Manager Engineer at 3M. Previously, I held multiple engineering roles at Verizon,
    where I led projects across the full stack — from backend microservices and AEM cloud deployments to
    frontend React development and CMS authoring enhancements. I enjoy solving complex problems, working with large-scale cloud systems,
    and building beautiful, efficient software.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m passionate about automation, performance optimization, and clean, modular design. My experience spans Spring Boot, AEM, GraphQL,
    AWS, and containerization with Docker and Jenkins pipelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of coding, you’ll find me exploring the outdoors, reading about new tech, or working on creative video projects.
  </p>
